- [x] Bid Rejected Scenarios<br />
    - [x] If there exists no bid against the item and bid amount is less than base price<br />
    - [x] If there exists a bid against the item and upcoming bid is less than the sum of highest bid and step rate<br />
- [x] Auction not found scenarios<br />
    - [x] If auction is expired<br />
    - [x] If auction is null<br />

## Problems Resolutions
#### ‚≠ê Auction Closing
__Problem:__ Close auction as soon as duration ends and send email to winner using a messaging queue since only the security service has the capability to send email to users

__Possible Solutions__
##### 1. MongoDB + Kafka
Using Mongo db and kafka together and set ttl to so that when auction duration ends it will be deleted from database and send message to kafka to send email message to email service

Reason to Reject: This approach will delete the auction from database once the duration ends

##### 2. RabbitMQ
Passing messages to RabbitMQ with delayed execution parameter so that it initiates when auction is over

Reason to Reject: Auctions can last for hours and storing messages in message broker is not a good practice

##### 3. AWS Lambda + RabbitMQ
Using lambda delayed execution and RabbitMQ together so that when ends lambda will start its operation make necessary changes in the database and send message to RabbitMQ to send winner email.

Reason to Reject: 

##### 4. Async + RabbitMQ
Executing asynchronous threads that will wait till auction duration ends and then close the auction and send message to RabbitMQ to send winner email.

Reason to reject: Closing the program will terminate all the asynchronous threads that are waiting to close their corresponding auctions.

##### 5. Spring Scheduler + RabbitMQ
Scheduling a job every 20 sec to close all the running auctions that are expired and send message to rabbitmq to send winner email. In this approach, situation might occur where auction duration has ended but still the status is Running so to cop up with that we can add an additional condition in bidding service to check if the auction has expired or not.If the auction is expired no bid can be placed against this auction.

Reason to Accept: Every auction will be closed sooner or later even if one job fails next job will compensate. Additional condition will prevent users to bid on an expired auction even if it is not closed.
